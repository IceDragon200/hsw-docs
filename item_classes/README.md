# Item Classes

Item Classes are a generalized explanation of a wider group of items, for example, instead of having documents for every-single ingot in the game, the Item Class simply generalizes the concept of an [Ingot](metal_ingot.md), this makes reasoning about common crafting or mechanics that rely on classes of items easier.
