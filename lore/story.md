# Lore - Story

Before the events of the game, this gives a brief overview of what happened up until that point.

Harmonia was once populated by a humanoid race known as the Maphir.

Misconceptions surrounded their creation, outsiders linking their appearance to Belle.

In reality the Maphir like many races of the abyss came about as a result of the formation of Harmonia itself.

The abyss populated Harmonia with sentient life which took the form of the Maphir.

The newly ascended Belle took charge of the world as its sole and only goddess to date.

To many it seemed suicidal for a newly ascended goddess to take on a newly formed world all by herself, but Belle proved more capable than her peers had ever imagined.

Taking the newly formed Harmonia from its primitive and archaic age all the way to a technologically advanced race in the span of a few centuries.

Belle's methods were different from other gods who were reliant on worship from their followers, she provided knowledge and tools and asked for nothing in exchange.

Belle had an advantage over her pairs: her skills with mana allowed her to absorb and cycle mana as if she were a world tree, something no other deity could do, this gave her a massive leg up against her peers: she wasn't reliant on her worshippers
