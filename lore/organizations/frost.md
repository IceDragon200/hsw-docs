# Lore - Organization - FROST

**Era** Emergent

A former ally of the Azeros, specialized in cryogenic tooling and weapons, as well as their private super soldier program.

FROST was known for its brutality during the war and the frowned upon usage of child soldiers, unfortunately for much of the world, FROSTs war crimes were lighter than those of their enemies and their power sorely needed.

However after the nuclear war reached its climax at the hands of former head of the Azeros, FROST turned its attentions inward with a mountain of battle scared and traumatized child soldiers now returning to their home soil as broken men and women.

FROST would eventually face its collapse at the hand of its own hubris and its AI system RAIP which had gone rogue.
