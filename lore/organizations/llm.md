# Lore - Organization - Llama Core Tek

**Era** Emergent

Also known as LLM (not to be confused with Large Language Models), Llama Core Tek specialized only one field: stuff that goes boom.

High explosive, cluster bombs, rocket launchers, grenades, mortar, and general explosive ballistics, Llama Core Tek was in the top three of "war" focused companies of its Era, only second to the Azeros.

Little was known of its leadership, and it was no secret that LLM Core Tek funded and supplied all sides of the war, if only to see it continue for another quarter.
