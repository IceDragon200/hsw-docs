# Lore - Organization - CLAW

**Era** Paradox

The Scarlet Empire's crowning jewel, saviour and eventually downfall, CLAW was a designed a fully autonomous unit with the only real authority being the emperor himself, a man with failing health.

Once the Emperor was no longer able to command CLAW, it was believed to have run wild, destroying the empire that once commanded it.

However, reports from survivors of the war say otherwise: CLAW was their saviour in an empire that had gone rogue and wild with ambition and power, with the death of th emperor, countless tried to seize his throne of power turning the once prosperous nation upside down.

Had it not been for CLAW stopping the pointless conflict, the world would have seen another war despite being in shambles.
