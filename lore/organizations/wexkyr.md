# Lore - Organization - Wexkyr

**Era** Post-Paradox, Domain War

A major faction playing an instrumental role in the survival of the Tri-Race Alliance of the Post-Paradox era, but also the originator of the Enlightened when its leadership had been absent for a brief period.

The Wexkyr were well known for the contribution to the worlds they visited, resolving civil wars or dealing with border disputes, in addition to their genorosity in teaching and medical tech.

The Wexkyr owned fleets of airships used to travel between worlds and their primary living space as their home world had become inhospitable by the presence of Kyrstone which had taken over the entire surface.

Subsequently the Wexkyr made extensive use of their natural enemy and resource the Kyrstone, as it was the earliest known MEMS, though had a few stability issues unless refined.
