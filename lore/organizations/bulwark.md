# Lore - Organization - BULWARK

**Era** Paradox

BULWARK was a secondary autonomous unit built by the Scarlet Empire during the Scarlet Ash War, on the surface it was to be the support and utility group to CLAW, but behind the scenes, those in charge feared CLAWs growing power and presence as well as the Emperor's waning health.

BULWARK unfortunately never saw formal deployment at the hands of the Empire, but rather by CLAW itself which activated and seized control of the unit, BULWARK was however tasks with the protection of the remaining lives following the events of the Mana Waves.
