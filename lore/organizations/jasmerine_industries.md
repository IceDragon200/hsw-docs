# Lore - Organization - Jasmerine Industries

**Era(s)** Domain War, Fracture

Formed by the young couple Torwan Jasmerine and his wife Lancea Jasmerine, maiden name Balfine.

Jasmerine Industries was founded as a civillian first armoury to prevent a repeat of Wexkyr turned Enlightened or abuse of authority that would become rampant after the Enlightened War.

Working closely with FeXiN to train and arm civillians for self-defence, it wasn't without its issues initially, but the Jasmerine Industries name became a home stay.

Diversing their products from general weapons to appliances and even clothing at one point, Jasmerine Industries had remained a people-first business for much of its life.

In the Fracture era with the emergence of the PONA, they have focused on non-combative applications of the war machines, ranging from mining operations to construction, as well as accessories for the small NAMUs.
