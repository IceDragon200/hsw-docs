# Lore - Organization - Kamdanian Order

**Era** Fracture

**Domain** [Kamda](../kamda.md)

Having witnessed the destabilization of the abyss as a whole, a group only known as the Kamdanian Order fled from the surface worlds into the depths of the abyss and founded Kamda a world with near filter properties compared to the surface world.

What better place to avoid the disruption of the abyss, than in the abyss itself?

Ironically they had the correct idea, while the surface worlds became disturbed and unstable, those in the lower abyss remained oddly untouched.

Kamdanians aim for purity that a life of mana without entropy, they do not reject the mana of the abyss, but rather aim not to pollute it which could lead to instability.
