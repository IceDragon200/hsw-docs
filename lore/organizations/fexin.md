# Lore - Organization - FeXiN

**Era(s)** Domain War, Fracture

Depending on who you ask, FeXiN is either the public servant who brought many of the conveniences enjoyed by the Wexkyr and its immediate allies to the general public, or the literal Abyss, a machine built and profiteering from the suffering of others.

It should be stated FeXiN of the Domain War Era and that of the Fracture Era are completely differnt beasts, with the Fracture era's lab turning arms dealer and experts in PONA technology, as well as the sole holders of ASTRA//PONA, the progenitor of the autonomous units.
