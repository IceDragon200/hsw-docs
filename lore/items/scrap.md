# Lore - Item - Scrap

Unclassified pile of abyssal junk, maybe if you sort through it, you could find something useful.

## Lore

Scrap, or simply "abyssal junk" is a form of Material Element that appears in the world, it can be broken apart by hand to release the materials, or be placed into a Recycler which will perform the same task more efficiently.

Scrap can ultimately be coerced into more of the same type of its drop by a Transmutation Matrix.
