## Lore

The codex was created by the goddess Belle as a device that could gather knowledge for its user and provide a encyclopedia and lookup utility for them in the process.

The first codexes resembled books and stone tablets as was common for the medium in the past.

As technology developed, so did Belle's original design of the Codex, while it's functions have mostly remained the same, it was given a technological aesthetic to fit with the era.

Despite the Codex's complex functionality, while in the world of Harmonia making a new one can be done from even WME, as the goddess' blessing applies broadly to the world.

Codexes outside of Harmonia have been noted to remain operational though with limited power.
