# Lore - Item - Bio Lab Access Card

Used to gain access to the Bio Lab, it can be crafted via the Element Crafting system to nearly free.

In reality it's just a normal Green [Access Card](access_card.md) with a custom description, the secret it uses is generated at the start of the world and matching terminals will pull from that same secret.

Players can even guess the key if they feel like doing that, however in the progression of the game it is impossible to craft Access Cards normally.
