# Lore - Concept - Nanosuit

The Nanosuit designed by Aix Republic to enhance their soldiers with the latest tech.

It was originally designed to be a skintight suit conforming to the wearer and enhancing their sensitivity to the unseen force of mana, while also enhancing their natural abilities by supplementing them with: Mana, Element and raw energy.

Due to the demanding requirement on the wearer's nervous system with the ultra-heightened senses from the nanosuit, wearers are curated and undergo what many called "inhumane" training to meet its requirements.

Nanosuits are designed to preserve the life of their wearer first and foremost and will continue to support their life even after death, as soldiers are rare and hard to train.

## Wearer First

Nanosuits aim to preserve the life of their wearer above their own continued operation, sometimes shedding or even suspending functions the suit seemed unneeded to the survival of the wearer in case o mortal injuries.

## Oversaturation

Nanosuits oversaturated with mana were deemed to behave... strangely.

Often preserving and seen forcefully reanimating its wearers even after death, binding their spirit to the physical world through an artificial ethereal body.

It's unclear how the suit performs such a task at this time.
