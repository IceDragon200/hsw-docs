# Lore - Concept - Abyss

The cosmic container in which all life exists, but is forever hungry and consumes all of creation within it.

The abyss is not so much an entity, but more so a system of various functions, from the formation of Genesis Seeds, to the ruins of past worlds, the birth of "memories" which gives life.

Yet the Abyss' ulimately goal is purity, not to build, but to erase all that is to return everything to a clean slate.

Life itself fights against the abyss, while also living within it.

One cannot exist without the other, but the abyss will always ultimately win.
