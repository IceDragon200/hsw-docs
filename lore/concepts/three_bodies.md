# Lore - Concept - Three Bodies

Not to be confused with the three body problem.

The Three Bodies refers to the:

* Physical Body (Material)
* Ethereal Body (Glue)
* Spirit (or Soul, but rarely called such)

## Physical Body

The physical body is a shell which protects the ethereal body.

It exists in the surface worlds and gives shape to the spirit.

## Ethereal Body

The ethereal body is non-physical, and also non-tangible, and is seen more as a concept than a reality, but there is no doubt that some third component exists which binds the spirit from the abyss, unto the surface worlds.

Without this ethereal body, spirits are naturally drawn back to the abyss.

## Spirit

The spirit, or the soul exists as an entity capable of gathering memories.

Spirits are in a constant state of decay when not bound to a physical body through their ethereal body.

The abyss is constantly attempting to strip the memories from a spirit to feed itself.
