# Lore - Concept - BCN

Also known as the BULWARK Credit Network, a simple monetary exchange developed by a few volunteers who were versed in programming and ran primarily by BULWARK with NORI's oversight.

It was created to provide some kind of exchange system for the survivors of the Scarlet Ash War to trade goods and services in a then familiar system.

NORI had extended the networks operations to other worlds and as of now becomes the standard for trading services amongst most smaller abyssal domains.

It's even compatible with the Wexkyr's old card systems!

The currency is simply called the BC, or BULWARK Credit.
