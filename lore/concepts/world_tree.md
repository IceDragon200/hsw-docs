# Lore - Concept - World Tree

World trees are living entities which form domains or worlds around them by cycling mana between the abyss and the space the tree occupies.

World Trees are packed to the brim with memories used to form the liveable land, and support life.

Depending on the maturity and experience of a world tree, they can be capable of building whole worlds in a matter of days, but on average worlds are formed slowly over years.

## The Circle of Life

World Trees are formed from the sacrifice of a spirit which becomes the initial seed, known as a Genesis Seed, these seeds contain the necessary memories and initial energy required to stabilize a domain into existence.

Once a seed has been "planted", it will typically form its roots first and form ME around itself creating its body and terrain.

Once stable, trees will begin using its vast pool of memories to attract mana from the abyss to form life, slowly feeding the negatively charged mana back to the abyss to attract more positively charged mana to continue building.

## Dead Worlds

Dead Worlds experience an unregulated flow of mana both to and from the abyss as a whole.

With a world tree to regulate the flow, positively charged mana floods the world which in turn creates and oversaturation leading to more negatively charged mana from the memories which in turn attracts more positive mana.

These worlds collapse exponentially as life becomes unbearable for most.
