# Lore - Concept - Mana

Mana from the concept point is the energy of the universe, but can also solidify into matter.

Ultimately everything is mana in one shape or form.

While it's theories and systems varying from domain to domain, mana is the life blood of everything.

## Theory - Mana Charges

One theory is mana has a "charge", either positive or negative, mana originating from the abyss is always positive.

While mana spent is always negative.

The reasoning for this has to do with the resource the Abyss wants most: memories.

By providing "clean" or positive mana to the surface worlds, the abyss can harvest memories formed that come into contact with the mana.

When the mana becomes weighed down by the memory, it is considered negatively charged and will return to the abyss through the world tree.

## Theory - Aspect Element

Mana by itself is shapeless, and memory is what gives it shape and purpose.

As a result, mana can be imprinted with a particular aspect, be it fire, water, wind or earth for example.

The AE, or Aspect Element describes how the mana is "shaped".

## Theory - Material Element

Negatively charged mana that fails to return to the abyss in a timely manner begins to gather and settle upon the surface, creating a physical object in the process.

This solidified form of mana is called Material Element, or ME for short

All life is a form of ME, as it is from the "memories" of life that they exist in the first place.
