# Lore - Concept - Ouroboros System

The Ouroboros System, the snake eating its own tail, the cycle of creation and destruction.

The Ouroboros System was designed by FeXiN before the events of the fracture, it was loaded unto a temporary Wexkyr Spirit Core, but was not linked at the time.

During the fracture, it's lead programmer was caught up in the mana disturbance and both the core and the programmer were fused and thrown across time itself.

Ouroboros would go on to cause several abyssal disturbances before being intercepted by R41NA and neutralized.

The system would eventually find its way back into the hands of the newly awakened NORI of the Fracture timeline who further developed it and sent it on its way.

While the original intent of the system's design has long been lost, it is believed based on the history of the PONA project of the time, it was likely suppose to augment some creation or... reproduction system.

## What exactly is it?

As stated, it is the concept that represents the cycle of creation and destruction, or rather: iteration.

For as long as the abyss has existed, the original Ouroboros had also existed, taking on the form of a humble core of sorts.

It came into contact with NORI during the end of the Paradox era's cycle and was bound to his spirit.

With the Paradox reset complete, NORI vanished from the active abyss but was located by Wexkyr engineers who attempted to study his makeup, but to no real avail.

With the collapse of the Wexkyr after the Domain War Era, Falcon resumed study of NORI's remains, FeXiN derived 2 systems from this: Command and Control system given to Astra and the Ouroboros System which was incomplete due to the events of the Fracture.

To complete itself, the Ouroboros System, using the core it was given performed its own Paradox loop to gain as much information and experience as possible before being caught and having its progress undone by the error correction program R41NA.

The Ouroboros Core would make contact with NORI once more during the Fracture restoring NORI's functions.

## Primary Function

The Ouroboros' primary functions are:

* Fabrication and Iteration
* Destruction and Analysis
* Preservation of Host for Persist Mission

In other words: the Ouroboros only cares about performing its primary Fabrication and Destruction in a loop and will persist it's host's life to achieve that goal.
