# Lore - World - Domain - Derelik

__Appears In__ Surface Story

__Abyss Position__ Upper Abyss

__Class__ Neutral, Junkyard

Named after "derelict", Derelik was home to much of the surface and upper abyss' trash that hadn't fallen prey to Pyrotha in this region.

It also happens to be one of the few places one could theoretically setup base.

Home to piles upon piles of scrap, the world is seen as a massive junkyard.
