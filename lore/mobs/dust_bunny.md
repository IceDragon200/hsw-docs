# Lore - Mob - Dust Bunny

Odd apparitions that form when a spirit inhabits ME particulates.

At their most harmless, Dust Bunnies run away from the PC and are more so an environmental indicator than a threat.

In more extreme causes the build up of dust starts to attract mana which sparks and creates disruption, these dust bunnies can temporarily disrupt machines they interact with... for better or worse.

In rare situations, these bunnies can even cause element erosion, thankfully they only affect the player and not physical objects.

## Origin

Believed to be from a future timeline where magic had become advanced but highly volatile, the Dust Bunnies were a byproduct of the mana built up in these worlds.

Unable to exit to the world tree and into the abyss, the accumulated memories of the spent mana gave mind to the ME thereby attracting a spirit to possess and animate it.
