# Lore - Mob - Seniflora

The Seniflora are a race of sentient flora, typically agricultural crops.

Sporting little arms and legs and maininting their crop appearance, the Seniflora are blind and detect objects by their mana.

Due to their origin and purpose of providing food for their original creator, the Seniflora improve farmlands and enjoy growing crops if given a chance.

They are active mana filters, and can act as mini world trees, thereby taking mana from the abyss or surface and filtering them through their body.

Their filtering process does not harm them.

## Origin

The Seniflora were created by Tana, a familiar created by a World Tree Agent by the name of Saewina.

While originally mistaken to be hostile, Seniflora are actually non-hostile despite their eagerness to tackle anyone they see.
