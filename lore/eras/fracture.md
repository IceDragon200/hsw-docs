# Lore - Era - Fracture

With the return of the R41NA error correction program the abyss was thrown into chaos, as what it had considered normal was viewed as invalid and corrupt by R41NA, in an effort to correct this the program began a massive restructuring and restoration process which effectively "fractured" the abyss as it was known.

This created the fractured timelines of which an explosion of alternate histories and even futures had been formed.
