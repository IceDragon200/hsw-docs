# Lore - Era - Pre Paradox

Following the collapse of humanity and even its conquerers.

The Pre-Paradox era comes about when the True Primordial Will reconstructs the universe from the memories of those that lived in the previous era.

Folding the fact, the fiction and fantasy into a new existence, magic becomes real, and science intermingles with the arcane.

The abyss exists here, but is more so a static and lifeless space.
