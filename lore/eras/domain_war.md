# Lore - Era - Domain War

With stability returned to much of the abyss, fate had other plans by throwing everything and into chaos once more.

With the opening of the fabled Layer 0 zaonith space, the abyss and its countless domains are thrown into chaos.

From this the collapse of the Wexkyr as a whole with its eventual dissolution into the tri-race alliance.

Its leader, Falcon hands over the keys to the Wexkyr and founds FeXiN as a purely research group with the remaining remnants of the former Wexkyr who decided to follow.
