# Lore - Era - Paradox

One of the key eras within lore, which includes the Scarlet Ash War.

## Technical Notes

For the most part, the only important parts of this era are the development of CLAW and BULWARK, as well as the Yellow Guild incident which had the most mana wave disruptions.

Paradox is where the story of Harmonia Scarred World takes place in its Surface mode.
