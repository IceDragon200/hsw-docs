# Lore - Character - Alkemi

The travelling merchant Alkemi, a woman who dabbled in the abyss' power far deeper than she was suppose to and became touched by its powerful mana.

It's unclear what she was before as she refused to elaborate, but her new form left her as a demon, without horns.

Her hands suffered the most being disfigured and looking more akin to a true demon, massive and overflowing with the abyss' power.

Alkemi however hasn't let her appearance stop her from procuring the best alchemical products ever made.
