You, the player character, you have no name and are simply refered to as the PC internally for lore reasons.

Characters in world also don't refer to you by a name.

The PC was formerly human, but due to "dying" in the teleporter event is considered a new form or life, the closest would be some kind of Nellakir hybrid.
