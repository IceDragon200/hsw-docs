# Lore - Character - Nori

Stylized as NORI in CLAW and BULWARK culture, Nori is also known as the machine god, or machine father or mechanical leader.

Unchallenged and defacto leader of both CLAW and BULWARK, Nori was feared as a war machine with a thirst for conflict.

He was also noted as being quite curious about humanity and life in general, often helping out of curiosity rather than necessity.
