# Element

For the purpose of HSW, Element is the material form of mana, commonly seen as WME (Weak Material Element), or simply called Material Element, when [Aspect Element](ae.md) appears in the same topic.

While there are processes for turning Element back in [Mana](mana.md), it's considered quite inefficient and vice-versa.

## Lore

There is no greater frustration than academics agreeing on the name of something.

And nowhere is this more annoying than anything related to the forsaken abyss.

Enter Mana-Elemental Mass State or... ugh, MEMS, let's just say the apprentices laughed their way to graduation majoring in the... MEMS.

Despite it's hilarious naming, the concept of MEMS, okay, Material-Element, ME for short is a fascinating one.

Mana generally general attaches to anything it can find, flowing through and across any and everything it can find, and then making a return to some conduit into the abyss, most will recognize this process from world trees.

However, ME is a special case, when mana decides to flow upon itself and interlocking into a stable lattice, it takes a tangible form that can be molded and shaped with some effort.

Once it's in that state, it loses most of its potential energy and becomes a pretty strong polymer, at least in some cases.

Engineers managed to replicate the same natural process with a bit of controlled mana bursts but the resultant material left a lot to be desired, in true naming fashion, the lads decided to throw on Weak to the name and prefix a "We" to the MEMS.

Oh, history, never change, let's just say within an hour of the official term hitting the academies, it was immediately banned and forty-seven formal complaints were filed within half-an-hour.

As such, the now ACCEPTED term is WME.
