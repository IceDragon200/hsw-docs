# Magic

Magic is a pretty broad topic, so let's just cover the basics.

## Mana

Mana is the "energy" of magic, in universe [Element](element.md) is just the material form of mana.

## Lore

Magic has been a staple of the abyss since it's inception, one could argue even the scientific study borderlines on magic.

While the material junkies were killing themselves with laughter over WEMEMS, oh they're never gonna live that one down, the boys over on the abyssal studies dealt more in the... fabric or arcane.

Thanks to the material boys beating them to the punch, they had to settle of the good old academic trickery of sticking a prefix on it.

Aspect Element or AE for short was coined to describe the elemental charge of mana.

Observations lead to the discovery that mana held a charge, which would explain why it could even clump together to form a physical material.

However this charge had an interesting side effect, due to the structure of mana flowing in the abyss and by extension surface worlds, it could influence natural phenomena hereby changing properties that were considered stable.

In short, magic, conjuring flames from seemingly nothing was a normal thing now, given the correctly charged mana.

These Aspects or simply elements in some more... traditional circles could be reliably charged for: Water, Fire, Wind, Earth.

The four fundamental elements as they were coined, further tests managed to shift charges ever so slightly to give AE clusters an "alignment", be of Dark or Light, without its alignment it was considered devoid of alignment, or simply: Void.

Some had delved into mixing charges and discovered these mixtures resulted in new AE, Water and Earth had a tendency to produce plant matter, and many simply referred to it as Wood magic.

Water and Fire produced Steam, Earth and Wind resulted in Dust, Water and Wind resulted in volatile Acid, Fire and Wind formed highly Corrosive magic, Fire and Earth produced a slurry of molten earth, or Magma.

Many had packed the AE closely to encourage denser charges per-particulate, resulting in stronger AE concentrations.

The most common was that of Water, slowing the movement of the element which reduced its temperature forming Ice.

Fire, energetic as it always is, sparks to life in the form of Lightning.

Earth compressed and refined results in Metal.

And Wind, invisible to the naked eye begins to warp the very air via Pressure.
