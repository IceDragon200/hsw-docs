# Lore - World

Due to engine limitations in Luanti, domains are treated as seperate layers on the y-axis.

We have a whole 16 bits to work with after all (65k nodes from bottom to top, plenty of y-space).

That aside, most of the game takes place in the same domain, outside of onenode.

## Domains

The domains are ordered here in their y-axis appearance.

* Surface
  * [Kelesya](world/domains/kelesya.md)
  * [Harmonia](world/domains/harmonia.md)
  * [Aetheria](world/domains/aetheria.md)
* Upper Abyss
  * [Derelik](world/domains/derelik.md)
  * [Quamjum](world/domains/quamjum.md)
  * [Pyrotha](world/domains/pyrotha.md)
* Lower Abyss
  * [Kamda](world/domains/kamda.md)
  * [Wurfkale](world/domains/wurfkale.md)
  * [The Dredge](world/domains/the_dredge.md)
