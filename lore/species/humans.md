# Lore - Specie - Humans

Humans have existed since the beginning of time, though ever since the post-paradox era have been labelled invaders by most other species.

While they were originally the kings and queens of most worlds in the past, humanity had fallen off due to their short lifespans and their evolutional purity.

In a universe dominated by magic, being the one race that struggles with magic has its problems.

Yet, humanity has continued to exist in spite of its limits, most of humanity's best have all evolved (literally) beyond their origin, but are still celebrated.

It's no stretch to say some of Abyss' greatest heroes have came from humanity.
