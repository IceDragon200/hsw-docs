# Lore - Specie - Nellakir

After the Wexkyr's decline and eventual dissolution of the Wexkyr whose founder would go on to form the FeXiN, the Nellakir appeared in the Fracture era to carry on the torch the Wexkyr once carried.

To spread knowledge and to help those in need.

However the Nellakir had their own problems, conformity within their own members created stigma for anyone even slightly outside of the norm, outsiders or "aliens" to their species were not met with the stigma, but rather inherently seen as outsiders in need of guidance from the "wise" Nellakir.

It is believed their work lead to the construction of the Aix Republic's nanosuit.
