# Lore - Specie - Wexkyr

While the Wexkyr are not a specie, they can ultimately be identified as one due to their technological changes to their bodies.

Most Wexkyr live within their spirit cores and can be transplanted from body to body whenever the previous one is damaged or lost, as long as their core is intact.

The core itself is specially carved by the high priest of the Wexkyr and the ceremony or procedure for binding a spirit had been originally guarded closely by the high priest.
