# Lore - Specie - Beast-Kin

The Beast-Kin have existed alongside humans as their natural foil.

While beast-kin were considered magically inferior, their naturally strong bodies and resilience to mana made them capable fighters and family makers or other races

Not to mention, beast-kin culture oriented more around community than the individual which was a powerful draw for magical races who suffered at the hands of humanity, particularly dragons.
