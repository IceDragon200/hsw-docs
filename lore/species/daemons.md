# Lore - Specie - Daemons

A Celestial which is recontracted to a god after becoming a Demon, becomes a Daemon, it can be seen as a mark upon their life letting everyone know they had once been cast aside by their former god.

Daemons are therefore more a title than a specie, but are often associated with fallen angels who find new fate, their tainted appearance remains, but their allegiances are changed.
