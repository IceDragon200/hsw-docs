# Surface Story

The original intended story for HSW.

It follows the PC after they begin their initial training for their own military only for the compound to be attacked and then having the teleporter they were using to be destroyed.

As a result, the nanosuit that covered their body becomes fused with their very flesh tying their very existence to a suit originally intended to enhance their abilities.

This game mode is suited for new players as it's slower paced and teaches mechanics in a mostly safe environment.
