# Freeplay

Freeplay can be considered the open sandbox approach, players are free to do whatever they like, in any order without respects to story or lore.

Recipes, tools, and areas are not locked behind any special game flags and players are free to explore all available features in this mode.

As such, Freeplay doesn't stick to any particular era and can be considered the: everything all at once era, if that makes sense.
