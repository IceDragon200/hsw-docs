# Game Mode - Surface Story - Progression

To iterate once more, the Surface Story is the default and should be considered the entry point into HSW as a whole.

As such, there is a tutorial section, but it allows the player to run around in the training compound initially.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves, the original progression documents had broken everything down into chapters, but here we'll break them down into arcs (the old progression was modified to reflect this as well).

For this new progression we'll have to outline what features, characters, and story beats need to be met first.

## Old Progression - 2025-11-30

Below was an outline of the old progression that HSW was based around.

The actual details of this progression system are omitted since it's a waste of time to port it from the original documents, instead the outline items are presented here.
