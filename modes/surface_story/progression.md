# Game Mode - Surface Story - Progression

To iterate once more, the Surface Story is the default and should be considered the entry point into HSW as a whole.

As such, there is a tutorial section, but it allows the player to run around in the training compound initially.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves, the original progression documents had broken everything down into chapters, but here we'll break them down into arcs (the old progression was modified to reflect this as well).

For this new progression we'll have to outline what features, characters, and story beats need to be met first.

## Progression - as of 2025-12-20

So here starts the new progression.

* Arc 0 - [Training / Tutorial](progression/000_training_tutorial.md) - For the opening arc, it will follow in the footsteps of the original progression, by opening with the training compound exercise.
* Arc 1 - [Ouroboros](progression/01_ouroboros.md) - Where Arc 0 taught the player movement and how to interact with the world, Arc 1 will teach them how to craft and generally survive
* Arc 2 - [Grave Callings](progression/020_grave_callings.md) - Sticking with the original script still, Arc 2 sees the player finally leave the Celestial Tower and coming face-to-face with the world.
* Arc 3 - [Bio Lab](progression/030_bio_lab.md) - The player makes a visit to the Bio Lab completing some minor missions, like installing replacement copper cables to power the lab.
* Arc 4 - [Mana Wave](progression/040_mana_wave.md) - With the revelation of the mana plague, the player leaves the Bio Lab when Nori feels a shift in the environment, in this arc, players are introduced to Mana as a resource, and mechanic, and some mobs will now drop mana related items upon death.
* Arc 5 - [Radio Tower](progression/050_radio_tower.md) - After receiving an announcement from the "Emergency Services" of Harmonia, the player needs to make a visit to one of the Radio Towers, but first they'll need iron tools, more specifically the crowbar.
* Arc 6 - [Kamda](progression/060_kamda.md) - The player returns to the Celestial Tower to find a teleporter newly activated which leads them to the domain of Kamda.
* Arc 7 - [Foundry](progression/070_foundry.md) - The player returns to the Celestial Tower to find a teleporter newly activated which leads them to the domain of Kamda.
