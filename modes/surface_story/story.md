# Game Mode - Surface Story - Story

The surface story should be considered the "default" story line and primary campaign for new players.

It follows the player character, a soldier from a nameless nation who barely escapes a training exercise that was interrupted by a mysterious entity's attack.

Failing to escape the training compound safely, their teleporter is destroyed and sends them hurling through time and space, torn apart by the forces.

Now stranded in a broken world, cue the title, Harmonia.

## Lore Timeline

The surface story was the original and primary mode intended for the overall game, as of such it was based around the "pre-paradox" timeline initially, after some modifications here and there, it moved to a "paradox" era story, but incorporates elements from "fracture", I suppose technically its a fracture story set in the paradox timeline,  which works.

If you have no idea what any of that means, then don't worry about it, this is more so a note for IceDragon200, than you, he'll know what it means.
