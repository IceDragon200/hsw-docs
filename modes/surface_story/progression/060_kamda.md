# Game Mode - Surface Story - Progression - 060 Kamda

__Arc__ 6

__Tier__ Iron

The player is teleported to the domain of Kamda.

A new spawn point is created in Kamda's layer in case the player dies.

And an additional Celestial Tower is present in this layer.

This is the player's first introduction to a town or city of NPCs they can interact with.

The primary objective of this arc is to teach the player about trading and Bulwark Credits.

Once the player has traded enough items and credits, they will receive a message containing an access card blueprint, but the card's usage isn't specified.

## Flow

This Arc is mostly open-ended and can be done at the player's leisure, they only need to trade items with the Kamdanians to complete it.
