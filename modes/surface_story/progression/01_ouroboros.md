# Game Mode - Surface Story - Progression - Ouroboros

__Arc__ 1

__Tier__ WME, Wood

Arc 1 is the official start of the surface story, the PC wakes up in the Celestial Tower's lower floors and has to work their way up to the surface.

At this point, the player will still have the items they picked up from the previous Arc, granted most are WME based and will break fairly quickly.

This arc primarily takes place in the Celestial Tower and its completion marked once the player leaves it.
