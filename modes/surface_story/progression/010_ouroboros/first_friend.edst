  You flex your fingers, you don't feel any different, but something had changed.

  Receiving another blip from your message system, you check it.

  The sender of the "gift" was finally identified as the mysterious "Nori".

  You read their new message: "Greetings, sorry for the hasty message earlier, I've been trying to find anyone or anything in that world."

  Harmonia you wonder?

  "If you're up to it, I can establish a bi-directional channel between us moving forward."

  That sounded less of a question and more of: I already have it, just letting you know.

    @ Nori "Ha ha, indeed, I had backdoored your operational update with a small relay program."

  EH!?

    @ Nori "Sorry about that, but do know I have been trying to gain access to this world to investigate it, let us work together."

  What's in it for you?

    @ Nori "Your Ouroboros System is partly of my design, while it has evolved in my absence, it is quite compatible with my designs, but I am Nori, the machine god, as appointed by the abyss."

  Nori, the machine god, good to know.

    @ Nori "You seem unsurprised?"

  You aren't exactly sure, but he doesn't strike you as someone who cares much for his title, but more of his works.

    @ Nori "You are... correct, the title is only that, I care more for what I can do, than some label."

  Whatever your relationship is, Nori may prove helpful.

    @ Nori "Ha ha, for now, let's get you out of this tower."

  Tower?
