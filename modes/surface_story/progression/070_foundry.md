# Game Mode - Surface Story - Progression - 070 Thermal Expansion

__Arc__ 7

__Tier__ LEA

The player returns to Harmonia after receiving the mysterious access card and finds that things are highly unstable.

This Arc introduces greater mana and now thermal instabilities, requiring the upgrade of Iron with Nickel for LEA.

There is just one problem: the Alloy is locked behind another curse.

There are two major battles here, first are the PAWNs which will continuously spawn in foundry security checkpoints.

And the other is the boss of the Arc, the other is HOUND.

Players can get HOUND to appear by either destroying four PAWNs in the same foundry, or by activating the security system with the access card, this however makes the PAWNs far more aggressive.

## Flow

* Nori hints a new material called LEA, Low Expansion Alloy, but he mentions that the alloying process is cursed, just like Bronze was
* Finding one of the foundries and entering it with the orange access card
* Entering the warehouse section of the compound triggers the PAWN defence systems
* Foundries can no longer be entered safely until the PAWNs are defeated or HOUND is dealt with.
* Inputting the correct control code, or having Nori deactivate them ends the arc
