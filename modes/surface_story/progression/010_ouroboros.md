# Game Mode - Surface Story - Progression - 010 Ouroboros

__Arc__ 1

__Tier__ WME

Arc 1 is the official start of the surface story, the PC wakes up in the Celestial Tower's lower floors and has to work their way up to the surface.

At this point, the player will still have the items they picked up from the previous Arc, granted most are WME based and will break fairly quickly.

This arc primarily takes place in the Celestial Tower and its completion marked once the player leaves it.

The Arc's name comes from several things:

* The Ouroboros which is depicted as a serpent eating its own tail, which also plays on the fact the player has to recycle resources in the tower (cannibalizing them) to survive initially.
* It is also a hint on the name of the system which governs the Element Crafting (i.e. the Ouroboros System).
