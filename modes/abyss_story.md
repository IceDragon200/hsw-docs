# Abyss Story

**Era** Fracture

The Abyss Story can be seen as the sequel or an alternative future to the Surface Story, it takes place in a different domain structure all together where the player starts in the Abyss rather than on the surface.

It would be targetted for veterans of the game who understand it's mechanics well enough.
