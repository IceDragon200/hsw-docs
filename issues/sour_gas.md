## Summary

As part of the ongoing process to add some form of proper ore-doubling similar to Mekanism, we need access to Sulfuric Acid.

The purpose is to facilitate ore-doubling through more complex recipes and mechanisms.

### Resources

__Gases__

* Sour Gas
* Methane (Sweet Gas)
* Hydrogen Sulfide
* Sulfur Dioxide
* Sulfur Trioxide
* Sulfuric Acid Gas
* Sulfuric Acid (Liquid)
* Nitrogen
* Ammonia
* Argon

__Items__

* Sulfur
* Ammonia Crystal

#### Sulfuric Acid + Methane line

The primary resource here is Sour Gas (Natural Gas), and to split it down into Methane (Sweet Gas) and Hydrogen Sulfide.

* Pump Sour Gas (extracted from some sour gas vent in the world), some Amine solution would be involved here to justify the separation of the hydrocarbons from the Hydrogen Sulfide
  * Sweet Gas = Methane
  * Hydrogen Sulfide
 * Catalytic Oxider with different catalysts
   * Hydrogen Sulfide > Sulfur Dioxide 
   * Sulfur Dioxide > Sulfur Trioxide
 * Gas Blending Unit
   * Sulfur Trioxide + Steam > Sulfuric Acid Gas
 * Cryogenic Distillation Unit (Would be a higher tier version of the regular distillation unit, which includes a cryogenic catalyst item slot)
   * Sulfuric Acid Gas > Sulfuric Acid

#### Amine

Effectively Ammonia (NH3), can be made or found as minerals around the world.

Nitrogen can be obtained via:

* Air Separator - Low-tier machine that produces Oxygen, Nitrogen and trace amounts of Argon
* Cryogenic Distillation Unit - In atmospheric mode which will consume energy to produce Oxygen, Nitrogen and Argon
