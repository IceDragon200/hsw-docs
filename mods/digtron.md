# Mod - Digtron

Digtron is one of those mods that does one thing, make machines that dig tunnels, lay nodes and just generally automation.

Including it in HSW was more so an alternate choice for players instead of the destructiveness of YATM's Quarry, which was modelled after Buildcraft.

Once again, modified for HSW, so may be incompatible with any addon mods for OG Digtron.
