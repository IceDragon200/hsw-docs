# Mod - HSW Block Anchor

So originally I was playing around with anchoring blocks (chunk for those minecraft folks) and isolated my testing to this mod.

As of this writing, it's not actively doing anything, but maybe I'll add an actual block anchor node which does the same thing, no more fiddling with the vector!
