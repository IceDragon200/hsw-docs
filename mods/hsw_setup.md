# Mod - HSW Setup

At the start of a new world, HSW Setup has the purpose of asking the player what they want to do.

Ultimately I'd like to frontload this in the menu, or remove this mod all-together and ask players to just enable the gamemode they want to play when we get to that point.

It is annoying, error prone and breaks immersion, but what to do?
