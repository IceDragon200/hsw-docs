# Mod - HSW Workbench

Another core feature of HSW, most crafting is done using the workbenches rather than the crafting grid.

It allows recipes of 3 Items + 1 Tool, the whole gimmick of the workbench is it requires the use of a tool as part of the crafting experience, there is no UI for it and the entire thing is done in world.
