# Mod - Foundation

If this is your first time seeing foundation, then don't worry, by itself, it does nothing.

Foundation is just a library used by HSW and its other mods to provide some common functionality and a module registration and versioning system.

Foundation makes developing mods a tad bit faster by wrapping up all the common functionality into a easy to use table.
