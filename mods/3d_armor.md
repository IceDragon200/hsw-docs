# Mod - 3D Armor

3D Armor is de-facto mod for adding armour and clothing to the player model in general, seeing as I didn't have the patience to fiddle with Blender to make a whole new model to duplicate what has already been done (and to completely wreck compatability!), I decided to haul 3d armor over, granted it's from an older version.

This was partly because I liked the old [hazmat_suit](hazmat_suit.md) mod and wanted to adapt that to HSW as well.

The version of 3D Armor present in HSW is modified and may not be fully compatible with upstream.
