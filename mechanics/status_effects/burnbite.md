# Mechanic - Status Effect - Burnbite

__Class__ Slip-Damage, Slow

While frostbites occurs when exposed to extreme cold, Burnbites are from an exposure to extreme heat, having basically the same effect with the added worry that it doesn't expire as quickly as a Frostbite.

Burnbite is more targetted versus [Burn](burn.md).
