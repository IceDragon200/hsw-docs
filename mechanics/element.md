# Mechanic - Element

__Type__ Resource

If [Mana](mana.md) is the energy of the world, then Element is the physical counterpart, while lorewise it's also just a form of Mana, Element represents a malleable yet unstable resource used to give something form.

Gameplay wise, players accumulate element slowly over time, or by breaking down other items into it.

Element can then be used to form new items where applicable.

It's most common result is WME, or Weak-Material Element, a stable but weak application of Element fabrication techniques.

## Usage

Element is one of the natural sinks of [Dirty Mana](dirty_mana.md), however only the player has this system, therefore the player's presence is the only sink for Dirty Mana normally.

And players will no longer "sink" Dirty Mana if they have no capacity for Element.

## Function

Element itself is a resource used by the Element Crafting system to make something from "nothing", primarily WME and related products, in game, some items are provided to the player via the Element Crafting system ahead of their normal procedures, such as Access Cards which require Plastic normally for normal crafting.

Element itself is the refined form of Dirty Mana when it is stabilized enough to be usable outside of the abyss.
