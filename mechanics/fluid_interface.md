# Mechanic - Fluid Interface

__Type__ System

As there was no real fluid system in the engine at the time of creating YATM, a Fluid System was provided by YATM.

The Fluid Interface is the "interop" between different nodes, items and participants allowing any node to take or put fluids into a container.
