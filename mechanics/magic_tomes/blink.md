# Mechanic - Magic Tome - Blink

**AE** Void

**Level** 1

While considered a level one magic tome, many have expressed concerns over the techniques difficulty in mastery.

Blink allows the caster to move forward instantaneously over a distance.

Blink often gets confused with [Teleport](./teleport.md), the difference is Blink moves the caster in a linear path, if there are obstacles Blink cannot bypass them.

In short, if you could reasonably walk to a position, you can blink to it.
