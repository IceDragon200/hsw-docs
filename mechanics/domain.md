# Mechanic - Domain

__Type__ System

From a development standpoint, a Domain and the Abyss function similarly, a container for spirits and mana.

However a Domain refers to a physical "world" within the Abyss in this context.

The overall game world is split into different Domains which form borders between different worlds, as there are no dimensions in Luanti as of this writing, Domains are more of stratums but should be treated as if they were different worlds.
