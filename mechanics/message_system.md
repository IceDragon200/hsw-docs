# Mechanic - Message System

The "Message System", or message inbox is a mechanic used primarily by the story focused modes to deliver story elements to the player.

Some characters may send messages to the PC over the course of the story which can include advice, general lore chatter or even some operational updates for the nanosuit.

During Freeplay, the message system is unused.
