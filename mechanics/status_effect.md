# Mechanic - Status Effect

Status effects are linger changes or processes applied to an object over time.

Think of poison, which inflicts damage to an entity over time until it expires or the entity dies.

Status effects may apply to:

* Players
* Other Entities
* Nodes

Players and entities typically share the same status effects, but nodes can also have their own status effects.
