# Mechanic - Element Crafting

A infinite source of items and materials, Element Crafting allows the creation of items from [Element](../resources/element.md).

However to balance this out, costs are usually absurdly high and element capacity is locked behind extremely expensive or difficult to obtain nanosuit upgrades.

Non-player based Element Crafting is also locked behind near-endgame machines.

It's primary usecase however is the creation of WME and it's respective tools which are very low grade tools that can be used for crafting or harvesting items in the world.
