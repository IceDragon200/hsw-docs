# Mechanic - Element Crafting

__Type__ Function

An "infinite" source of items and materials, Element Crafting allows the creation of items from [Element](element.md).

However to balance this out, costs are usually absurdly high and element capacity is locked behind extremely expensive or difficult to obtain [Nanosuit](nanosuit.md) upgrades.

Non-player based Element Crafting is also locked behind near-endgame machines.

Its primary usecase however is the creation of WME and it's respective tools which are very low grade tools that can be used for crafting or harvesting items in the world.

## Function

* Element Crafting or Fabrication as its sometimes called is the process of transforming raw Element into a physical object
