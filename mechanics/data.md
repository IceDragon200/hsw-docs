# Mechanic - DATA

__Type__ Function, System

The DATA mechanic or rather the DATA Network is a functional mechanic in HSW, it allows some devices to share information or "data" via cables or wirelessly, depending on the recipient device it can perform a particular action or even long running tasks.

DATA is more of machine communication protocol rather than something the player will directly interact with, but machines are expected to be programmed by the player.
