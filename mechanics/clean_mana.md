# Mechanic - Clean Mana

__Type__ Resource, Function

Clean Mana is the primary resource of Mana, provided by the Abyss to all domains in order to attract its use and subsequent discharge to provide Dirty Mana for the Abyss to consume.

There is no need for an extensive writeup on Clean Mana as its mostly a neutral resource until it is used, think of it as Coal in the magic world, healthy when you just look at it, problematic when you starting burning it and releasing CO2.

## Function

Clean mana by itself is dormant and unlike Dirty Mana doesn't actively affect the world unless explicitly used.

* Clean Mana recovers slowly over time by input from the Abyss
* Clean Mana is absorbed by living entities and when depleted returns as Dirty Mana in the block
* Clean Mana cannot directly become dirty without memories
