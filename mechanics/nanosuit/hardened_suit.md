# Mechanic - Nanosuit - Hardened Suit

As you no longer have a body, the measly element of your nanosuit would not be enough to protect you from the elements much less a worthy foe.

The hardened upgrade may not feel like much, but it increases your survivability.

## Effects

* + 100 HP Max
* + 5 Defence
