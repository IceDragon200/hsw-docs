# Mechanic - Nanosuit - Wexkyr Spirit Core

**Era** Post-Paradox

**Organization** Wexkyr

The legitimate Wexkyr originated Spirit Core upgrade, moving your spirit from the shackles of its physical body to a enclosed and highly optimized spirit core.

For you, this frees up your nanosuits processing capabilities by allowing it to efficiently circulate mana to your spirit.
