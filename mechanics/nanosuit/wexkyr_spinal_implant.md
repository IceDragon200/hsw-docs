# Mechanic - Nanosuit - Wexkyr Spinal Implant

**Era** Post-Paradox

**Organization** Wexkyr

Falcon's crowning jewel and the most recognized product of the Wexkyr's influence on most worlds, the Spinal Implant has been at the centre of Wexkyr engineering far longer than its own existence.

The implant was designed to attach to the surface of humanoid spines incorporating a seamless fusion and greatly increasing mana flow, and sensitivity.

It is a necessary piece for Wexkyr soldiers and a great addition to any normal civillian or would be adventurer.

## Lore

Apart from their master over inter-world travel, the Wexkyr had mastered the fusion of man and machine through mana, their crowning jewel being their spinal implants made from Kyr stone or black stone as many know it, these embedded devices would fuse to their user's spine and made them more attuned to mana.

## Effect

The Spinal Implant specifically helps with mana recovery and capacity.
