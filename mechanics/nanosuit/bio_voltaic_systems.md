# Mechanic - Nanosuit - Bio-Voltaic Systems

**Era** Domain War

**Organization** Wexkyr, Enlightened

From the less ideal side of the Wexkyr's History, their engineers delved a little too deep into the biology of beings and to put things likely: broke the system.

The Bio-Voltaic system I'm presenting you today allows you to store energy from the foods you eat, but do not look further than that functionality.
