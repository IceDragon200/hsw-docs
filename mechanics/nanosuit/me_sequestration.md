# Mechanic - Nanosuit - ME Sequestration

Mana is Element, Element is Mana, your nanosuit can be adapted to preserve this simple fact and avoid wasting valuable element and mana in the process.

A wonderful side effect is understanding that everything is just stone if you blink hard enough.

## Effects

* + 1 Mining Level (Applies to items and skills that utilize player mining rather than tools)
* + Temporary ME nodes now restore Element when despawned
* + Nodes with mana will keep their mana upon being mined (even with tools)
