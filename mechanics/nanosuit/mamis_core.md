# Mechanic - Nanosuit - Mami's Core

**Era** Fracture

**Origin** Mami

The Mammoth Spider itself, ugh, I shudder to think the damage it could inflict had it not become friendly with the world serpent.

Regardless Mami's consist of whole domains and zaoniths alike, as of lately however she's taken a liking to cinnamon rolls.

This module is compliments of Mami herself as I was spared when she found me snooping around her space.

The effects speak for themselves.
