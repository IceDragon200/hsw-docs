# Mechanic - Nanosuit - Isotopic Stable Suit

**Era** Fracture

**Organization** Pegasus Forge

Pegasus Forge has been known for the quality of their equipment and making the impossible possible.

Their work into defensive materials including environmental immune developments for PONAs had found its way down to the regular soldiers of their infantry divisions.

The Isotopic Stable Suit or rather its components, the ISFNX (Isotopic Stable Fexinelle) had taken years to miniaturize, while a far cry from the original material intended for PONA deploment, these smaller variants also do not require Fexinelle, a difficult material to manufacture and develop in your limited world.

It certainly helps that you aren't wearing that suit, but are the suit, normally you'd only be resistant.
