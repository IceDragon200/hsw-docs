# Mechanic - Nanosuit - Element Skeletal System

**Era** Fracture

**Origin** Aresete

From a far off domain, a Jaraa Witch by the name of Aresete developed a rare bone mutation which gave her a very metallic skeleton, from the records, she started with a titanium reinforced skeletal system until her body evolved it into Kyrstone.

Seeing as no one was available to monitor how such a thing happened, we only have the faint memories of the abyss to work with.

The principle is well grounded in bioengineering however, adding trace amounts of element to the bones until it accepts the Element that has become part of it.

## Effects

* + Increased resistance to fall damage
* + Increased resistance to recoil (from firearms, and general tool usage)
