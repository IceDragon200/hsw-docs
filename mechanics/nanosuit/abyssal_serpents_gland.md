# Mechanic - Nanosuit - Abyssal Serpent's Gland

**Era** Pre-Paradox

**Origin** Emmerich

As promised for your assistance, the gland of the abyssal serpent, or... one of many, since Abyssal King Emmerich had faced defeat so many times, it's not exactly hard to find his remains, an intact poison gland however is a different case.

While Emmerich had famously used his latent ability to conjure antidotes, it was far more capable than his kind heart would allow.
