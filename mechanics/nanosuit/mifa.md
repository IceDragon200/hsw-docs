# Mechanic - Nanosuit - Mabel's Inventory Fabrication Agent (MIFA)

**Creator** Mabel

While Mabel is often overshadowed by her co-worker turned husband Gungnir, as time progressed she gained a mastery of the abyss and created MIFA, or simply IFA, the Inventory Fabrication Agent, capable of taking almost any command and fabricating the necessary item given enough element.

The system was capable of processing orders even while the user rested.
