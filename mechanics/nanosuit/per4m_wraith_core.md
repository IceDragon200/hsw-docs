# Mechanic - Nanosuit - PER4M Wraith Core

**Era** Fracture

**Organization** Pegasus Forge

A revised version of the PONA Wraith Core system originally built by Alex Stone, the PER4M, or "Perform" core was miniaturized for NAMU units that needed the extra power afforded by the powerful core, all without the nasty side effects.

## Effects

TODO, should increase mana capacity and regen like most while also allowing higher tome levels.
