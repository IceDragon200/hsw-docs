# Mechanic - Nanosuit - Mana Frame

**Era** Fracture

**Origin** FeXiN

FeXiN of the PONA timelines is a beast of an entity, even Pegasus Forge knows better than to play silly games with them.

That aside, the Mana Frame is a product I have personal interest in as a substitute for the metal cases we call bodies.

You and I can agree, a more fitting existence awaits us.
