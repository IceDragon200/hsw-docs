# Mechanic - Nanosuit - RED Materials Protocol

**Organization** Wexkyr

It's not clear what the RED means in its name, but images from the Wexkyr's homeworld revealed, Kyrstone or Blackstone sometimes appeared as a red metal when it had been refined by the harsh mana storms of the surface.

The material was known to be highly unstable and was a major call for concern amongst miners as it could destabilize rapidly causing a chain reaction amongst the Kyrstone present.

Let's just shorten and say, mana storms of that magnitude are not your favourite memory.

That aside, the RED protocol outlines advanced material mining, and extraction.

## Effects

* + 1 Mining Level (Applies to items and skills that utilize player mining rather than tools)
* + Abyssal materials will no longer cause "Abyssal Oddity" upon being mined
* + If "Contract with the Blackstone" is present, allows the fabrication of Kyrstone
