# Mechanic - Nanosuit - Viscus Core

**Era** Post-Paradox, Domain War

**Organization** Wexkyr

After being frail as a toothpick for quite the number of cycles, it's time to put some of that element to use in building up the nanosuit's bulk.

The Wexkyr had done research into artificial bodies since the beginning, as the originators of the Spirit Core, they understood the construction of more bodies than even the Primordial Will itself.

By reconstructing missing muscle fibres with element, the nanosuit can respond much more effectively to physical movement.
