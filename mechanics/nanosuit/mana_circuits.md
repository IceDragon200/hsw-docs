# Mechanic - Nanosuit - Mana Circuits

**Organizations** Wexkyr, Jasmerine Industries, BULWARK

Originally your mana circuits would have grown like your muscles and tissues.

Unfortunately for you, your body was totalled in the teleporter accident, so your nanosuit now has to imitate those biological development you were suppose to have.

Thankfully the Wexkyr and many others had already pursued such technologies, albeit for different reasons.

## Lore

Your physical body is long gone, however your nanosuit is capable of mimicking the natural mana ciruits that would form in your body, fortunately for you, mana isn't just a dream.

## Effects

* + 50 Mana Max
* + 1 Mana Regen
