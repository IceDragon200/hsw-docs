# Mechanic - Nanosuit - Cryogenic Dissipation Module

To be perfectly honest, you're probably the only person I've met that actively tries to hold cryogenic materials with their bare hands.

I've tinkered with your nanosuit's heat control, this should allow you to handle most cryogenic materials safely moving forward.
