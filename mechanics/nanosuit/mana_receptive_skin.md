# Mechanic - Nanosuit - Mana Receptive Skin

**Era** Fracture

**Organization** CLAW, Pegasus Forge

Pegasus Forge at it again, with the MRS, the Mana Receptive Skin, originally deployed for NAMUs, it also doubled as a thin film over humanoids to increase their mana capabilities.

For you however, this makes your nanosuit's surface skin more receptive to absorbing mana, that also means you can now store mana on and near the surface of the suit.

## Effects
