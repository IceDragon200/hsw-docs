# Mechanic - Nanosuit - Embedded Guide to Abyssal Materials (EGAM)

**Era** Domain War, Fracture

**Creator** Lowan Jasmerine

From the man, the myth, the legendary Wexkyr engineer and Wexkyr high investigator Lowan, comes a detailed guide on how NOT to shoot yourself in the foot while handling magical materials in the workplace.

Back in the day, the Jasmerine Industries gave these books out like candy at fairs.

In your current state, well you weren't attending them anyway.

I've transcribed the most crucial parts of Lowan's piece of OSHA writing in a language your nanosuit understands.
