# Mechanic - Dirty Mana

__Type__ Resource, Function

Dirty Mana, Negative Mana, Depleted Mana, Corrupted Mana, it goes by many names but it all represents the same concept, mana that has been used by domains now laden with memories naturally flow back to the abyss where it will be consumed and purified as part of the natural cycle.

Dirty Mana which stagnates or doesn't return to the Abyss in a timely manner will give form to the memories and surrounding mana.

This in turn attracts or even attaches to spirits who usually ride this mana on a trip back to the Abyss leading to the creation of apparitions with unresolved memories, often not even belonging to those who tagged along.

Reapers were employed as a secondary system to ensure that Dirty Mana is not given form via lingering spirits, these reapers are responsible for retrieving spirits from the Surface and escorting or even forcing them to return to the Abyss for purification.

## Function

From a functional aspect ingame, Dirty Mana is the depleted form of Mana, in Harmonia there are no natural sinks for Dirty Mana and so it remains on the surface indefinitely requiring the player to intervene.

Dirty Mana is a natural by-product of:

* Using Mana via Tomes for magic
* Natural recovery of Mana on entities
* Machines equipped with Spirit Cores that utilize mana to augment its operation
* Any "living" entity (which includes the undead and apparitions) whether or not they utilize mana
