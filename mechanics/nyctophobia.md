# Mechanic - Nyctophobia

__Type__ Function, System

Nyctophobia, or fear of the night causes the player to take damage during the night in low light levels.

But it's a far more complicated system underneath.

The "default" implementation that ships with Harmonia (not HSW) is affected primarily by light levels and time of day.

In HSW however, the system is a bit more complicated and is tied to the [Spirit](spirit.md) and [Dirty Mana](dirty_mana.md) systems.

Unbound spirits within a block add to the "voices" heard during the effects of Nyctophobia increasing its damage, Dirty Mana attracts more spirits to a block, so the effects of Nyctophobia can be used a gauge on how saturated a block is.

Naturally mana and dirty mana want to equalize across a [Domain](domain.md) so the effect will be spread out over the world rather than concentrated.

## Lore

The lore explanation is memories and apparitions become far more active night, seeking live hosts to inject themselves into, which causes actual pain and torment.
