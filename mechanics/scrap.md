# Mechanic - Scrap

Sometimes material can be dredged up from the abyss, but it's just a pile of unsorted material known as Scrap.

Scrap randomly produces reduces when used, but can produce more when placed in a dedicated "Recycler" or a "Transmutation Matrix" which takes scrap and uses mana to copy items normally produced by the scrap reliably.
