# Mechanic - Spirit Core

__Type__ Resource, System

The Spirit Core is an artificial ethereal and physical body, trapping a spirit in the world in a "safe" manner, while allowing them to still access the flow of mana when utilize.

Ethics aside, Spirit Cores are special upgrades or even "engines" for some machines and entities.

When used in machines, spirit cores apply multiple changes to the machine's performance, some positive and some negative if placed in the wrong machine (a ignis core in a freezer will do you no good for example).

For entities it acts as the "personality" or "engine" that drives their existence, not necessarily their behaviour such as in the case of maidroids.
