# Mechanic - Spirit

__Type__ Resource, System

Spirits are formless entities that linger in various domains temporarily until they are taken back by the Abyss or by a [Reaper](reaper.md).

Spirits are 1/3 of the component of what is considered a [body](/lore/concepts/three_bodies.md).

Spirits bound to an artificial ethereal and physical body are the premise for the [Spirit Core](spirit_core.md).

Ingame, spirits are a resource provided by the abyss which form the "entity" spawning systems and spirit lantern attractions.
