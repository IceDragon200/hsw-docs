# HSW - Docs

Welcome to the [Harmonia Scarred World](https://github.com/IceDragon200/mt-harmonia-scarred-world) documentation and lore dump.

## Developing

Most of the documentation is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) and [EDST](https://github.com/IceDragon200/ex_edst) for story text.

## About "Scratchpad" sections

Some documents may include a Scratchpad section, this is just miscellaneous notes which may not have been formally written to the document, but kept to continue a particular train of thought.

Think of it as the "aha, that's what I was thinking" bit.
