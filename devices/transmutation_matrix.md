# Device - Transmutation Matrix

Takes scrap, a "filter" item and typically mana of some sorts to produce more of the same item consuming the scrap.

Note to produce the same item, 2 scrap is consumed regardless of rarity, this makes the matrix inefficient for common materials but efficient for rarer ones.
